This blog is based on [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/) - static site generator written on Go. GitHub interaction is organized with use of [Hosting on GitHub Pages](http://hugo.spf13.com/tutorials/github_pages_blog) tutorial. See "Configure git Workflow" section specifically.
 
And for all of the git 1.7.x (and older) users - you can grab *git-subtree* from *contrib* directory of [Git repo](https://github.com/git/git). I've used *git-subtree* from latest 1.8.x. It's just a shell script, run ```make```, ```chmod +x git-subtree``` and copy it to */usr/lib/git-core*.
